Repository for the VLSI SRAM project group Bits And Giggles 

All Simulation files are labeled with a `_TB` in its file name. The most top level entity is the `1Mb_SRAM_BG` schematic. The most up to date Pi simulation model is PiModel_Full_BG_Will, and the adexl_1 contains the PVT corner setup for voltage, process, and temperature.
